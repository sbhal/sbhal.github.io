- BARAKSHA Ceremony + GODBHARAI Ceremony

Barakhsa is a ritual when all dear one of the bride’s family, usually male members, gathers and goes to the groom’s home to bless him with gifts such as clothes, sweets, fruits as shagun. Traditionally, gold rings and gold chains are offered to the groom by the bride’s family members as a token of love, respect and acceptance in the family.

Godbharai is a ritual performed to bless the bride from the groom’s family. In this ceremony, all the women from the groom’s family gather and go to the bride’s home and bless her. A girl’s godbharai means that she is accepted as a daughter in law of the family. Just like Baraksha, a priest is invited to perform the rituals to get the god’s grace for the couple. The ‘to-be bride’ is also adored by gold products like chain or ring or bangles or all from the groom’s family member.

The engagement ring is worn on the index finger.
Gifts are presented to ‘the would-be bride and groom,’ such as sweets, and other gifts, including return gifts to all the guests.

## Kua Pujan in Mandir
At the time of marriage, the boy and the boy’s mother are worshiped in a nearby temple after the groom sits on the horse. In a soup, 2 earthen balls, skewer rice, turmeric, and batase are kept. The mother worships the well with rice, turmeric and batash, after that the groom makes seven rounds around the well, which means seven rounds.

Picks up a skewer for every circumambulation and puts it in the well. That’s why I keep seven skewers in the soup. The mother then pretends to be angry and threatens to jump into the well. The groom laughs and celebrates the mother and says mother, don’t be angry, I will bring a red daughter-in-law for you.

After that the groom leaves the procession without looking back without looking at his face in the bowl of oil. It’s an old custom and is performed in almost every family the same way narrated here.

## Dwar Rokai
It takes place when the bride comes to the groom’s home after vidai. The sisters block the entry of a newlywed couple to enter into the house and confront the wish of getting gifts from the groom in exchange of allowing him to enter the house with his wife. There is a little light-hearted argument that takes place, and everyone enjoys the moment.

## Griha Pravesh
After the dwar rokai, the griha pravesh ceremony takes place. The bride is allowed in the house with all respect and joyful hearts. A small arti also takes place. The bride then pushes the jar/kalash full of rice with the right toe and then enters the house. This moment specifies that the family has not only allowed her in, but also accepted her as a family member.

## Kober or Find the Ring Games
In this ritual, a ring will be hidden deep inside a thaal or bowl filled with milk, water, Kangnas, flowers, vermilion, and other objects placed in front of the bride and groom.
This thaal is placed by the sister in law of the bride and the couple is asked to find the ring from the thaal. Both the bride and groom are meant to put their hands into the bowl or thaal together and search for the rings by using one hand only.

It is the best of seven series, and the one, whosoever finds the ring four times is announced as the winner of the game.

## Mooh Dikhai
The relatives get to see the bride and offer gifts like gold or silver ornaments to her. Especially the groom’s mother offers gold or presents as a token of love and welcome.
